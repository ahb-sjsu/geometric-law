## The Five Open Problems

The geometric framework developed in this book is, by design, incomplete. The judicial complex is a *model* of legal reasoning, not a *replica*. The eight dimensions are an *approximation*, not a derivation. The Mahalanobis metric is *calibrated*, not proved. And the topological theorems are *conditional* on the model's assumptions, not absolute truths about the legal system.

This incompleteness is a feature, not a bug. A framework that claimed completeness would be either trivial or false. The geometric framework claims only that legal reasoning has geometric structure and that the structure is partially capturable by the tools of differential geometry, algebraic topology, and gauge theory. The five open problems identified below are the specific points where "partially" matters most — where the framework's current tools are insufficient and new mathematics, new data, or new legal theory is required.

## Open Problem 1: Metric Calibration

### The Problem

The legal metric — the Mahalanobis distance $d_M(c_i, c_j) = \sqrt{\Delta \mathbf{v}^T \Sigma^{-1} \Delta \mathbf{v}}$ — is the foundation of the entire framework. It determines which cases are "close" (strong precedent), which paths are "short" (compelling arguments), and which boundaries are "near" (hard cases). Every computation in the framework depends on the metric.

But the metric is *calibrated*, not derived. The covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is estimated from data — from the scored attribute vectors of decided cases. And the attribute vectors are themselves estimated from natural language by linear probes trained on expert-labeled data. At every stage, the calibration introduces uncertainty: measurement error in the dimension scores, sampling error in the covariance estimation, and labeling error in the expert judgments.

The open problem is: **How should the metric be calibrated, and how sensitive are the framework's conclusions to calibration choices?**

### What We Know

The Algorithmic Jurisprudence manuscript demonstrated that a Mahalanobis metric calibrated on a corpus of 10,000 federal court opinions produces retrieval results that correlate well with expert judgments (Spearman's $\rho = 0.72$ between Mahalanobis distances and expert similarity ratings). This is encouraging but not conclusive. The correlation is computed on a specific corpus, in a specific legal domain (federal civil rights cases), using a specific embedding model. Whether the calibration transfers to other domains (commercial law, criminal law, family law), other jurisdictions (state courts, international tribunals), or other legal traditions (civil law, Islamic law, customary law) is unknown.

Several specific calibration questions remain open:

**Domain dependence.** Should the covariance matrix be estimated globally (one $\Sigma$ for all of law) or locally (a separate $\Sigma_D$ for each legal domain $D$)? The choice matters enormously. A global $\Sigma$ treats the correlation between statutory authority and remedial scope as a universal property of law; a local $\Sigma$ allows this correlation to differ between commercial law and constitutional law. The correct answer is almost certainly local, but the granularity of the domains — how finely should the law be partitioned? — is an open empirical question.

**Temporal stability.** The covariance matrix changes over time as the law evolves. The correlation between precedential constraint ($d_6$) and entitlement structure ($d_1$) was probably stronger in 1850, when stare decisis was near-absolute, than in 2025, when the Supreme Court has overruled precedent at an accelerating rate. Should the metric be re-estimated annually? Every decade? After every landmark decision? The framework provides no guidance on the temporal dynamics of calibration.

**Cross-rater reliability.** The dimension scores depend on expert labeling, and experts disagree. Two legal scholars may assign different entitlement scores to the same case, reflecting genuine differences in legal interpretation rather than measurement error. The framework treats inter-rater disagreement as noise to be averaged out, but it may be signal — evidence that the "true" dimension score is indeterminate, and the metric is inherently uncertain.

**Sensitivity analysis.** How much do the framework's conclusions change when the metric changes? If a small perturbation to $\Sigma$ changes the nearest precedent, flips the materiality assessment of a breach, or creates a spurious Wilson loop, the framework's conclusions are fragile and the calibration must be more precise. If the conclusions are robust to small perturbations, the calibration need only be approximate. A systematic sensitivity analysis — computing the framework's outputs under perturbations to $\Sigma$ and measuring the resulting variation — has not been performed.

### What Would Solve It

A complete solution would require:

1. A **calibration protocol** specifying the corpus size, domain structure, temporal window, and labeling procedure required for reliable metric estimation.
2. A **sensitivity theorem** bounding the change in framework outputs as a function of the change in $\Sigma$: $|\Delta \text{output}| \leq L \cdot \|\Delta \Sigma\|$ for some Lipschitz constant $L$.
3. An **uncertainty quantification** procedure that propagates calibration uncertainty through the framework's computations, producing confidence intervals rather than point estimates for distances, breach magnitudes, and Wilson loop holonomies.

None of these currently exist. The metric calibration problem is the most practically urgent of the five open problems, because every deployment of the framework — every time a court uses JurisGraph or its successors — depends on the metric being adequately calibrated.

>
> *Rivera recalls the early days of geometric jurisprudence. In 2028, a district judge in the Southern District of New York used the manifold to assess a breach of contract case. The system identified a material breach with breach magnitude $\beta = 0.83$. The opposing party's expert challenged the metric calibration, arguing that the covariance matrix used was estimated from a corpus of technology contracts and was inappropriate for the real estate contract at issue. Using a real-estate-specific covariance matrix, the expert showed that the breach magnitude dropped to $\beta = 0.41$ — below the materiality threshold.*

Apex Development, 2029 — became the foundational case on metric calibration, but it did not resolve the deeper question: what makes a calibration "correct"?*
>
> *Twenty years later, the question remains open. Different circuits use different calibration protocols. The Ninth Circuit estimates $\Sigma$ from the most recent 10,000 cases in the relevant domain. The Second Circuit uses a rolling 20-year window. The Fifth Circuit uses a fixed national corpus. The resulting metrics are similar but not identical, and Rivera has seen cases where the choice of calibration changes the outcome.*

> *She writes in her retirement notes: "We have built the manifold, but we have not fully understood its metric. The next generation must."*

## Open Problem 2: Cross-Jurisdictional Invariance

### The Problem

Chapter 14 established that each national legal system is a separate manifold with its own metric, gauge group, and constitutional subcomplex. Treaties connect the manifolds via connection maps. But the framework assumes that the eight legal dimensions — entitlement, factual nexus, procedural posture, statutory authority, constitutional conformity, precedential constraint, remedial scope, public interest — are *universal*: the same eight dimensions apply to every legal system, though the calibration differs.

Is this assumption correct?

The open problem is: **Are the eight legal dimensions universal across legal traditions, or do different traditions require different dimensional structures?**

### The Universality Question

The eight dimensions were identified empirically from the analysis of common-law and civil-law traditions. They appear to cover the major axes of legal analysis in these traditions. But the world's legal traditions are far more diverse:

**Islamic law (Shari'a)** has dimensions that do not map neatly onto the eight: the distinction between *fard* (obligatory), *mustahabb* (recommended), *mubah* (permissible), *makruh* (discouraged), and *haram* (forbidden) creates a five-level normative scale on the entitlement dimension, not a binary right/no-right. The *maqasid al-shari'a* (objectives of Islamic law — preservation of religion, life, intellect, lineage, and property) define a different public interest dimension than the common-law version.

**Customary law** in many African and indigenous traditions operates without the procedural posture dimension ($d_3$) as it is understood in Western law. Standing, jurisdiction, and exhaustion of remedies are not gatekeeping functions in systems where disputes are resolved by community elders based on relational proximity rather than procedural authority.

**Chinese law** combines elements of civil law (statutory codes), socialist legal theory (law as an instrument of state policy), and traditional Confucian jurisprudence (law as a last resort, with preference for mediation and social harmony). The public interest dimension ($d_8$) is weighted differently — social stability and collective welfare may dominate individual rights in ways that the current framework does not capture.

If the eight dimensions are not universal, the multi-manifold framework of Chapter 14 requires modification. Instead of different calibrations on the same eight dimensions, different traditions would have different *numbers* and *types* of dimensions. The treaty connection maps would need to bridge not just different calibrations but different dimensional structures — mapping from an eight-dimensional common-law manifold to a potentially different-dimensional Islamic law manifold.

### What Would Solve It

A solution would require:

1. **Cross-cultural empirical study.** Score a corpus of cases from diverse legal traditions (common law, civil law, Islamic law, customary law, Chinese law) on the eight dimensions and test whether the dimensions capture the structure of legal analysis in each tradition. If they do not, identify the additional or alternative dimensions required.

2. **Dimensional reduction analysis.** For each legal tradition, perform principal component analysis on the scored cases to determine the empirical dimensionality of legal analysis. If some traditions have fewer effective dimensions (because some dimensions are redundant in that tradition) or more (because the tradition distinguishes axes that the common-law framework merges), the dimensional structure must be adapted.

3. **Inter-manifold mapping theory.** Develop the mathematics for connection maps between manifolds of different dimensionality. This requires a generalization of the fiber bundle model from Chapter 14, where the fibers over different points in the transaction space have different dimensions.

This problem is both mathematically deep (it requires extending the framework to variable-dimensional manifolds) and empirically demanding (it requires extensive cross-cultural legal analysis). It is unlikely to be solved without sustained collaboration between mathematicians, comparative law scholars, and legal anthropologists.

The Chinese delegation argued that the framework's constitutional conformity dimension ($d_5$) was calibrated to Western-style constitutional review and did not capture the role of the National People's Congress in Chinese constitutional interpretation.

>

The question is whether we need Einstein-level corrections or just better calibration."*

## Open Problem 3: Computability of the Fundamental Group

### The Problem

The topological constitutionality theorem (Chapter 7) uses path homology to detect constitutional violations. Path homology is computable in polynomial time for finite directed graphs — this is one of the framework's most attractive features. But path homology is not the only topological invariant of the judicial complex. The *fundamental group* $\pi_1(\mathcal{K})$ — the group of all directed loops in the complex, up to homotopy — contains strictly more information than the first path homology group $\widetilde{H}_1^{\text{path}}(\mathcal{K})$.

The relationship between the two is well-known in algebraic topology: the first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group. $\widetilde{H}_1^{\text{path}}$ detects *commutative* topological features — it can count the number of independent loops but cannot distinguish the order in which loops are traversed. $\pi_1$ detects *non-commutative* features — it can distinguish loops that, when composed in different orders, produce different topological outcomes.

The open problem is: **Is the fundamental group of the judicial complex computable, and does it detect legal inconsistencies that path homology misses?**

### Why It Matters

Legal reasoning is *non-commutative*. The order in which legal arguments are applied can change the outcome. Applying the burden-shifting framework of *McDonnell Douglas* before addressing standing produces a different analysis than addressing standing first. This non-commutativity is captured by the semi-direct product structure of the Hohfeldian gauge group (Chapter 5) and by the non-commutativity of legal operations (demonstrated empirically in the Geometric Ethics data, with 16,798 commutator measurements).

If legal reasoning is non-commutative, then the fundamental group — which captures non-commutative topological structure — may detect legal inconsistencies that the abelian path homology misses. There could exist legal contradictions that are invisible to $\widetilde{H}_1^{\text{path}}$ but visible to $\pi_1$: two directed loops that, when composed in one order, are contractible (consistent), but when composed in the other order, are non-contractible (inconsistent).

### The Computability Challenge

For general topological spaces, the fundamental group is *undecidable* — there is no algorithm that, given a finite presentation of a topological space, determines whether the fundamental group is trivial. This is a consequence of the Adyan-Rabin theorem, which reduces the word problem for finitely presented groups (known to be undecidable) to the triviality problem for fundamental groups.

However, the judicial complex is not a general topological space. It is a *finite directed graph* with additional structure: edge weights, Hohfeldian labels, hierarchical ordering, and temporal constraints. The question is whether these constraints make the fundamental group computable in the legal setting.

Several sub-problems must be resolved:

**The directed fundamental group.** The standard fundamental group $\pi_1$ is defined for topological spaces using continuous paths. For directed graphs, the appropriate analogue is the *directed fundamental group* (or fundamental groupoid) — the group of directed loops up to directed homotopy. This group has been studied (Grandis, 2003; Goubault, 2000) but is less well-understood than the standard fundamental group.

**Finite presentation.** The judicial complex, being finite, has a finitely presented fundamental group. Finitely presented groups are not in general decidable, but many specific classes of finitely presented groups (free groups, abelian groups, hyperbolic groups) have decidable word problems. The question is whether the fundamental groups arising from judicial complexes fall into a decidable class.

**Legal relevance.** Even if the fundamental group is computable, does it detect legal inconsistencies that matter? The answer depends on whether non-commutative legal contradictions — inconsistencies that depend on the order of argument composition — are a real phenomenon or a theoretical curiosity. If they are real, the fundamental group is legally essential. If they are not, the path homology (which is computable and already implemented) is sufficient.

### What Would Solve It

1. A **classification theorem** for the fundamental groups of judicial complexes, showing that they belong to a decidable class (e.g., residually finite groups, automatic groups, or CAT(0) groups).
2. An **example** of a non-commutative legal contradiction — a pair of legal arguments that are consistent when composed in one order but inconsistent when composed in the other — demonstrating that the fundamental group detects a genuine legal phenomenon.
3. An **algorithm** for computing the directed fundamental group of a finite weighted directed graph, with complexity bounds suitable for judicial complexes of realistic size.

In 2033, she attended a conference at the Institute for Advanced Study where a topologist presented a proof that the fundamental groups of citation networks are *residually finite* — they can be approximated by finite groups to arbitrary precision. This result implied that the word problem is decidable for these groups, and therefore that the fundamental group is computable in principle.*
>

>
> *Rivera had seen one case where she believed a non-commutative contradiction existed. A circuit split in the Seventh Circuit involved two lines of precedent on qualified immunity. Applying the precedent on excessive force before the precedent on reasonable suspicion produced one result; applying them in the reverse order produced another. The path homology detected a non-trivial cycle, but it could not distinguish the two orderings — it saw only that a loop existed, not that the loop's behavior depended on the direction of traversal.*
>
> *She reported this case to the IAS group, and it became Example 4.2 in their 2034 paper. But no court has yet used the fundamental group in a decision. The tool exists in theory; it waits for the computation to become practical.*

## Open Problem 4: Dynamic Complexes

### The Problem

The judicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ as defined in Chapter 3 is *static* — it is a fixed structure computed from the current state of the case law. But the law changes. New cases are decided, old precedents are overruled, statutes are enacted and repealed, and constitutional amendments alter the topological constraints. The judicial complex at time $t$ is different from the complex at time $t + \Delta t$.

The open problem is: **How should the framework model the dynamics of the judicial complex — the evolution of the manifold over time?**

### Why Static Models Are Insufficient

The static model works for a snapshot analysis: given the current state of the law, compute the nearest precedent, detect Wilson loops, and evaluate gauge invariance. But many of the most important legal questions are dynamic:

**Overruling.** When the Supreme Court overrules a precedent, the judicial complex changes discontinuously — edges are removed, weights are reassigned, and the topology may change. The static model can compare the pre-overruling and post-overruling complexes, but it cannot model the *process* of overruling — the gradual erosion of precedent through distinguishing, questioning, and narrowing that precedes the formal overruling.

**Legislative change.** A new statute adds vertices and edges to the complex. An amendment modifies existing edges. A repeal removes vertices and edges. The static model can compare the pre-statute and post-statute complexes, but it cannot model the legislative process — the interaction between proposed statutes, committee amendments, and final enactment.

**Doctrinal evolution.** Legal doctrine evolves through a sequence of cases, each modifying the complex incrementally. The *McDonnell Douglas* burden-shifting framework was not established in a single case — it emerged through a sequence of cases over decades, each refining the framework's elements. The static model cannot capture this evolutionary process.

### Approaches to Dynamics

Several mathematical frameworks are available for modeling dynamic complexes:

**Persistent homology.** The theory of persistent homology (Edelsbrunner, Letscher, and Zomorodian, 2002) tracks topological features as a parameter changes. Applied to the judicial complex, the parameter could be time, producing a *filtration* $\mathcal{K}_{t_1} \subset \mathcal{K}_{t_2} \subset \cdots \subset \mathcal{K}_{t_n}$ where each inclusion adds the cases decided between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$. The persistent homology of this filtration tracks which topological features (loops, holes, connected components) are born, persist, and die as the complex grows.

The challenge is that the judicial complex does not only grow — it also *shrinks* (when precedents are overruled and edges are removed). Standard persistent homology handles monotone filtrations (the complex only grows); the legal setting requires *zigzag persistence* (the complex can grow and shrink), which is mathematically more complex and computationally more expensive.

**Sheaves on the time axis.** A *sheaf* assigns data (the judicial complex) to each open set of a topological space (intervals of time) and specifies how the data on overlapping intervals are related. A sheaf model of the dynamic judicial complex would assign a complex $\mathcal{K}_I$ to each time interval $I$ and specify restriction maps between complexes on nested intervals.

**Stochastic dynamics.** If the law's evolution is modeled as a stochastic process (new cases arrive randomly, precedent erosion follows a decay function, legislative changes are Poisson events), the dynamic complex becomes a *random simplicial complex* — a rapidly growing field in stochastic topology. This approach would allow probabilistic statements about the complex's future evolution: "With probability $p$, a Wilson loop in the current complex will be resolved within $n$ years."

### What Would Solve It

1. A **dynamic complex formalism** that models the judicial complex as a time-varying object, with operations for case addition, edge modification, precedent overruling, and legislative change.
2. A **persistence theory** for directed complexes that handles both growth and shrinkage — zigzag persistence for path homology on directed graphs.
3. A **prediction framework** that uses the dynamic complex's history to forecast its future evolution: which Wilson loops are likely to be resolved, which precedents are likely to be overruled, and where new topological features are likely to emerge.

> *JurisGraph 5.0 (the version in use at the time) had no mechanism for handling the change. It had been calibrated on the pre-overruling complex.

>
> *JurisGraph 7.2, the version Rivera uses in 2045, handles dynamic changes better. It maintains a rolling window complex, updated daily as new opinions are filed. It tracks precedent erosion scores — a measure of how much each case has been distinguished, questioned, or limited by subsequent cases — and adjusts edge weights accordingly. When a precedent is overruled, the system performs an immediate topological recomputation, flagging all cases in the current docket that are affected.*
>
> *But the system still cannot predict which precedents will be overruled, which Wilson loops will be resolved, or where new inconsistencies will emerge. It is reactive, not predictive. Rivera believes that a predictive dynamic complex — one that can forecast the evolution of the manifold — would be the most transformative advance in geometric jurisprudence. But the mathematics for such a system does not yet exist.*

## Open Problem 5: International Law and Multi-Manifold Coherence

### The Problem

Chapter 14 developed the multi-manifold framework for international law: each nation is a manifold, treaties are edges, and conflicts of law are manifold selection problems. But the chapter left unresolved the deepest question: **Is there a coherent global legal manifold, or is international law irreducibly fragmented?**

In mathematical terms: does the treaty network $\mathcal{T}$ define a *consistent* fiber bundle, or does the bundle have non-trivial curvature everywhere — making every cross-border transaction subject to irreconcilable legal contradictions?

### The Coherence Question

A coherent global legal manifold would be one where the international legal bundle is *flat* — where parallel-transporting a legal position around any closed loop in the transaction space returns to the same position. Flatness means that the order in which you cross borders does not matter: going from the US to the EU to China and back produces the same legal position as going from the US to China to the EU and back.

The evidence suggests that the global legal bundle is far from flat. The curvature is non-zero in many transaction domains:

**Data protection.** The EU-US-China triangle studied in Chapter 14 has non-trivial curvature. The Vertex Dynamics impossibility region is a manifestation of this curvature — there is no compliant position for EU personal data processed in China.

**Taxation.** The global tax system has extensive curvature. A multinational corporation can structure its operations to take advantage of mismatches between national tax systems (double non-taxation through treaty shopping), or it can be caught in double taxation (the same income taxed by two or more jurisdictions). The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project is an attempt to reduce the curvature of the international tax bundle — to harmonize national tax systems enough that the holonomy of tax obligations around a closed loop is trivial.

**Human rights.** Different nations' human rights obligations are defined by different treaties (ICCPR, ECHR, ACHR, ACHPR) with different substantive content and different enforcement mechanisms. Parallel-transporting a "right to freedom of expression" from the ECHR system to the ACHR system produces a different right — different exceptions, different balancing tests, different enforcement mechanisms. The curvature is non-zero.

### The Fragmentation Problem

The International Law Commission has studied the *fragmentation of international law* — the phenomenon where different international legal regimes (trade, human rights, environmental law, investment law) develop independently and sometimes contradict each other. In geometric terms, fragmentation is the existence of multiple overlapping fiber bundles with inconsistent connections — the trade bundle, the human rights bundle, and the environmental bundle cover the same transaction space but with different fibers and different connection maps.

The fragmentation problem asks whether these overlapping bundles can be unified into a single coherent structure. If they can, international law has a consistent global geometry, and the contradictions between regimes are resolvable. If they cannot, international law is irreducibly fragmented, and the contradictions are structural — built into the geometry of the international system.

### What Would Solve It

1. A **curvature computation** for the international legal bundle, quantifying the non-trivial holonomy in specific transaction domains (data protection, taxation, human rights).
2. A **flatness theorem** identifying conditions under which the curvature vanishes — conditions on the treaty network that ensure cross-jurisdictional consistency. The OECD's BEPS framework could be analyzed as an attempt to satisfy these conditions in the taxation domain.
3. A **fragmentation metric** that measures the degree of inconsistency between overlapping legal regimes, providing a quantitative foundation for the ILC's fragmentation study.
4. A **coherence conjecture** — either proving that the global legal bundle can be made flat (by appropriate treaty design) or proving that flatness is impossible (that some curvature is inherent in any multi-sovereign system).

## Toward a Research Programme

### What Is Needed

The five open problems are not independent. They form an interconnected web:

- **Metric calibration** (Problem 1) affects **cross-jurisdictional invariance** (Problem 2), because the calibration protocol must handle multiple legal traditions with potentially different dimensional structures.
- **Cross-jurisdictional invariance** (Problem 2) feeds into **international coherence** (Problem 5), because the multi-manifold framework requires a consistent way to compare legal positions across systems with different dimensions.
- **Computability of the fundamental group** (Problem 3) intersects **dynamic complexes** (Problem 4), because the fundamental group of a time-varying complex is more complex than the fundamental group of a static one.
- **Dynamic complexes** (Problem 4) are required for **metric calibration** (Problem 1), because the metric must be recalibrated as the complex evolves.

Solving any one problem fully would likely require progress on at least two others. The research programme is inherently interdisciplinary — requiring contributions from mathematics (algebraic topology, differential geometry, computational complexity), computer science (NLP, machine learning, algorithm design), law (comparative law, international law, jurisprudence), and the social sciences (legal anthropology, political science, economics).

### The Modesty Principle

Throughout this book, we have maintained a principle of modesty: the geometric framework does not *replace* legal judgment; it makes legal judgment *auditable*. The framework does not determine verdicts; it provides a structural vocabulary for analyzing the reasoning that produces verdicts.

The open problems reinforce this modesty. The metric is calibrated, not derived — and the calibration is uncertain. The dimensions may not be universal. The topological invariants may not be computable in practice. The dynamics are not yet modeled. The international system may be irreducibly fragmented.

These uncertainties do not undermine the framework. They define its boundaries — the frontier between what the framework can do and what it cannot yet do. Every mature scientific framework has such a frontier. General relativity has singularities. Quantum mechanics has the measurement problem. The geometric framework for law has the five open problems.

The framework's contribution is not to have solved all problems of legal reasoning. It is to have translated the problems of legal reasoning into a mathematical language where they can be stated precisely, investigated rigorously, and — eventually — solved.

### The Promise

If the five open problems are solved — or even substantially advanced — the consequences for legal practice would be profound:

**Metric calibration** would give courts a reliable, validated metric for legal distance, enabling consistent precedent selection, reproducible argument evaluation, and meaningful comparison of legal systems.

**Cross-jurisdictional invariance** would provide a principled framework for comparative law — a way to translate legal concepts between traditions without losing structural information.

**Computability of the fundamental group** would unlock a deeper level of topological analysis — detecting non-commutative legal contradictions that the current tools cannot see.

**Dynamic complexes** would transform the framework from a snapshot tool into a temporal instrument — tracking the evolution of legal doctrine, predicting overrulings, and modeling legislative impact.

**International coherence** would provide the mathematical foundation for global legal harmonization — or, if coherence is impossible, would identify the structural barriers to harmonization and guide treaty design to minimize conflict.

The legal system still aspires to correctness, but it also aspires to *consistency* — getting the same answer in equivalent cases, regardless of who the judge is, what the defendant looks like, or how the lawyer writes the brief. And it aspires to *transparency* — making the structure of legal reasoning visible, so that the reasoning can be audited, challenged, and improved.*

## Chapter Summary

1. **Metric calibration** (Open Problem 1): The Mahalanobis metric is calibrated from data, and the calibration introduces uncertainty. A calibration protocol, a sensitivity theorem, and an uncertainty quantification procedure are needed.

2. **Cross-jurisdictional invariance** (Open Problem 2): The eight legal dimensions may not be universal across legal traditions. Cross-cultural empirical study, dimensional reduction analysis, and inter-manifold mapping theory are needed.

3. **Computability of the fundamental group** (Open Problem 3): The fundamental group of the judicial complex captures non-commutative topological features that path homology misses. Whether it is computable for judicial complexes, and whether it detects genuine legal contradictions, are open questions.

4. **Dynamic complexes** (Open Problem 4): The judicial complex evolves over time, and the static model cannot capture overruling, legislative change, or doctrinal evolution. A dynamic complex formalism, a persistence theory for directed complexes, and a prediction framework are needed.

5. **International coherence** (Open Problem 5): The global legal system may be irreducibly fragmented — the international legal bundle may have non-trivial curvature everywhere. A curvature computation, a flatness theorem, a fragmentation metric, and a coherence conjecture are needed.

6. The five problems are **interconnected**: progress on any one requires progress on at least two others. The research programme is inherently interdisciplinary.

7. The framework's contribution is not to have solved all problems of legal reasoning but to have **translated** them into a mathematical language where they can be stated precisely and investigated rigorously.

## Notes on Sources

The five open problems extend the discussion in the Algorithmic Jurisprudence manuscript (§13.4). Metric calibration connects to the broader problem of metric learning in machine learning — see Kulis (2013, *Metric Learning: A Survey*) and Bellet, Habrard, and Sebban (2015, *Metric Learning*). Cross-jurisdictional invariance connects to comparative law methodology — see Zweigert and Kötz (1998, *Introduction to Comparative Law*), Glenn (2014, *Legal Traditions of the World*), and Menski (2006, *Comparative Law in a Global Context*). The computability of the fundamental group is discussed in the context of the Adyan-Rabin theorem — see Adyan (1957) and Rabin (1958). Directed homotopy theory is developed by Grandis (2003, *Directed Algebraic Topology*) and Goubault (2000). Persistent homology was introduced by Edelsbrunner, Letscher, and Zomorodian (2002) and is surveyed in Edelsbrunner and Harer (2010, *Computational Topology*). Zigzag persistence is developed by Carlsson and de Silva (2010). Sheaves on topological spaces are standard — see Bredon (1997, *Sheaf Theory*). The fragmentation of international law is studied by the ILC (2006, *Report of the Study Group on Fragmentation*) and Koskenniemi (2006). The OECD BEPS project is documented in OECD (2015, *Explanatory Statement*). The concept of a coherence conjecture for the global legal system is original to the Geometric Law framework.
